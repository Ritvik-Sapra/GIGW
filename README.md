# GIGW
Completed this project during my internship period at ERNet. The project is a Web based software which lists all the Guidelines for Indian Government Websites (GIGW). An employee can check a particular website for compliance of these guidelines and tick the checkbox. The complete data will be stored in a database under the ID of the employee.
